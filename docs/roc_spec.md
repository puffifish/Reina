# ROC Specification (Phase 1)

ROC (Reina On-Chain AI) introduces the idea of using small, deterministic checks to improve the safety and reliability of on-chain operations. In Phase 1, ROC is limited to a basic spam-detection feature called ROC–Sentinel.

## Purpose

The goal is to demonstrate how AI-like logic can be integrated into a blockchain at a modest scale. By starting with lightweight checks, we keep node requirements low and avoid complex floating-point issues that can break consensus.

## ROC–Sentinel (Spam Detection)

- Simple Checks:  
  In Phase 1, ROC–Sentinel might reject a transaction if its fee is below a certain threshold or if sender and recipient fields are identical in some suspicious way.
  
- Deterministic Approach:  
  All checks rely on integer comparisons and clearly defined conditions. This keeps results bit-for-bit consistent across every validator, preventing any nondeterminism.

## Integration with the Chain

When a new transaction is submitted:

1. Sentinel Review: 
   ROC–Sentinel runs a quick series of checks. If a transaction fails, it is rejected. If it passes, it continues to the next stage (e.g., PoCUP tasks or eventual block inclusion).
2. Mempool or Chain Manager Calls:  
   The primary chain logic (sometimes called a mempool manager) calls the sentinel’s functions before admitting the transaction. This step is minimal but ensures basic transaction integrity.

## Future Directions

- ROC–Forge:  
  Potentially used to verify large-scale HPC tasks or advanced computations generated by validators.
  
- ROC–Arbiter:  
  An AI-based governance module that could score proposals or changes to chain parameters, flagging suspicious items.

- Federated On-Chain AI:  
  If performance remains satisfactory, larger or batched AI tasks might be introduced in later phases, possibly with aggregator nodes performing heavy work and providing proofs back to the chain.

By beginning with small, rule-based checks, Reina can seamlessly incorporate more ambitious AI modules over time without compromising security or performance.
